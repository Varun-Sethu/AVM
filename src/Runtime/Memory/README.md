# Memory


 - ### How it works
    - The allocator is based off the Stack Allocator designed by @mtrebi. <br> [Link](https://github.com/mtrebi/memory-allocators#stack-allocator)
    - There were some additional functions added to the allocator such as the defragmenter the reallocator and the auto extender.

    - **Complexity**
        - Defragmenting: O(n)
        - Allocation: O(1)
        - Free: O(1)
        - Realloc: O(n)??
            - Not too sure about this one
        - Space: O(n)
